This project focuses on analyzing sales performance data from a coffee shop to uncover key business insights and support data-driven decision-making. The dataset includes transaction details such as product categories, prices, quantities sold, payment methods, and store locations. Through comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the project aims to identify revenue trends, peak sales hours, customer purchasing behavior, and best-selling products. Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, formatting date and time fields, standardizing product categories, and converting transaction metrics into analytical formats. Visualizations were created using tools such as Excel, SQL, and Tableau to represent sales trends across time, weekday performance, and product-wise revenue contribution. Key findings reveal that weekends and morning hours generate the highest sales volume, and beverages—particularly coffee products—contribute the largest share of revenue. The dashboard also highlights seasonal patterns and identifies high-performing store branches. This project delivers valuable insights that can help managers optimize staffing, improve marketing strategies, manage inventory more efficiently, and increase overall profitability. The final output includes a Tableau dashboard, a summary report, and SQL queries used for analysis.
